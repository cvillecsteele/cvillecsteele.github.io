Our two children studied (clarinet and flute) with Christine from elementary school into and through high school. Though each child brought their own needs, desires and personality, Christine was a phenomenal teacher and mentor to both. Through weekly lessons, countless audition preparations and performances, Christine cultivated critical and consistent growth. She encouraged them to embrace performance and musical challenges while tending carefully and thoughtfully to the process and methods of their individual development.
